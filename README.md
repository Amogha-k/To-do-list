Project Name: To-do List Application

Overview:
I created a To-do List application to enhance my skills in web development by applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users efficiently manage their tasks by allowing them to create, track, and organize their to-do items.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks from the list as needed.

User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive interface that allows users to interact with their to-do list easily.

Persistent Data: Uses browser local storage to save tasks, ensuring that user data is preserved even after the page is refreshed or closed.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a consistent experience across different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for creating the structure of the application.
CSS: Applied for styling the user interface and ensuring the application is visually appealing.
JavaScript: Implemented for dynamic functionality, including task management operations and local storage integration.
Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of front-end development, focusing on creating a practical application that helps users manage their daily tasks. Through this project, I gained experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with browser storage for data persistence.
